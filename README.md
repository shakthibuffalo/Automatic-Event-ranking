# 🚀 Automatic Event Ranking

## 📌 Overview
Automatic Event Ranking is a machine learning-based system designed to analyze high-frequency sensor data and categorize driving events by severity. This helps in reducing false positives and providing real-time alerts for critical incidents, improving road safety and fleet management.

## 📊 Problem Statement
In large-scale fleet management, vehicles generate massive amounts of sensor data. Identifying and categorizing significant driving events (e.g., harsh braking, excessive speeding, sharp turns) is challenging. Traditional rule-based systems often generate excessive false positives, leading to inefficiencies and missed critical events.

## 🛠️ Solution
This project leverages machine learning techniques to process sensor data, extract meaningful features, and classify events based on severity. The system applies advanced transformations such as wavelet analysis and frequency-domain techniques to distinguish between true and false positives. The final model assigns severity scores to detected events, enabling better decision-making and alert prioritization.
